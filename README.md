# Drinks-For-Fun
(FOR A School Project) Fun and Interactive Drinking Game! This playful Python project turns a basic age checker into a virtual guest screening experience. It collects your name and birth year, calculates your age, and offers a tailored drink menu alcoholic for 19+ and non alcoholic for 16-18 with witty remarks. Cheers.
