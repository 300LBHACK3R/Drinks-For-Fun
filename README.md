Fun and Interactive Drinking Game 🍻
Welcome to the Fun and Interactive Drinking Game—an engaging Python project that turns a simple age-checking script into a virtual guest screening game! Crafted with intellect and ingenuity, this program not only evaluates a user’s age but also serves up a tailored drink menu with a playful twist. 🎉

Overview 👀
This project collects user input for name and birth year, calculates the age, and then:

Evaluates Access:
Users 19+ get the full alcoholic menu. 🍷
Users 16-18 receive a non-alcoholic menu (with a nod to the classics). 🍹
Users under 16 (or unrealistic ages) get a friendly “access denied” message. 🚫
Interactive Experience:
Enjoy colorful command-line prompts, complete with ANSI-coded output. 🌈
Discover a hidden Easter Egg if you enter the name "Tate" (yes, that’s you!). 🥳
Dynamic and Robust:
Handles input errors gracefully. ✔️
Offers random witty comments and drink suggestions to enhance the experience. 😎
