# Fun and Interactive Drinking Game

Welcome to the **Fun and Interactive Drinking Game**—an engaging Python project that turns a simple age-checking script into a virtual guest screening game! Crafted with intellect and ingenuity, this program not only evaluates a user’s age but also serves up a tailored drink menu with a playful twist.

## Overview

This project collects user input for name and birth year, calculates the age, and then:

- **Evaluates Access:**
  - Users **19+** get the full alcoholic menu.
  - Users **16-18** receive a non-alcoholic menu (with a nod to the classics).
  - Users under 16 (or unrealistic ages) get a friendly “access denied” message.
- **Interactive Experience:**
  - Enjoy colorful command-line prompts, complete with ANSI-coded output.
  - Discover a hidden Easter Egg if you enter the name "Tate" (yes, that’s you!).
- **Dynamic and Robust:**
  - Handles input errors gracefully.
  - Offers random witty comments and drink suggestions to enhance the experience.
